# The-Rain-Caller (Rain Scryer)

## Summary

Client requested an app that fetched 3rd party api calls that fetched data for current and 5-day weather forecast. The application created provides that functionality.

Link to live app: https://wtriii.github.io/The-Rain-Caller/

Features Implemented:
- 1 api call to find current weather based on user search of a city
- 1 api call to find a weather forecast for the searched city
- both apis fire when the search is run
- both apis return information and populate on the page

Limitations:

- Currently, a 5-day/3hour weather forecast api is used. There is no efficient way to break this down into 1 entry daily, so the forecast is in 3-hour increments over 5 days.
- no localstorage implemented

## Help Received:

I received assistance from Mitchell Robbins on the proper formatting of running an API call as well as reading the docs on each api. He also assisting in troubleshooting errors in my code. 

I used AskBCS for assistance on cutting down the number of entries, but they suggested that I use an incompatible api that would require another api for my app to be user-friendly (not use lat/long for search parameters).

# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Your Task

Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

Use the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve weather data for cities. Read through the documentation for setup and usage instructions. You will use `localStorage` to store any persistent data. For more information on how to work with the OpenWeather API, refer to the [Full-Stack Blog on how to use API keys](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/how-to-use-api-keys).

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index

WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe

WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
